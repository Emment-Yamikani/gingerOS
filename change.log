1. 
    a. Fixed "chdir()" syscall to set proper path if '.' or '..' is passed as new working directory.
    b. Added error cheching to prevent "chdir-ing" to a non-directory vfs object.
2. Added generic vfs mountat function,
   to enable easier "mount()" syscall implementation.
3. Added error checking to "iwrite()" and "iread()" as well as "iioctl()" generic functions
   to return -ENOTDIR when called on a directory.
4. Removed inode readers and writers queues so as
   to allow for binding of queues when need be.
5. Added "readdir()" syscall.
7. Added "tmpfs", but still working on file handling.
