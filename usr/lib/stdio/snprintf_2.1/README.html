<h1><b>snprintf.c</b>
<br> - a portable implementation of snprintf,
<br><font size="+1">including
vsnprintf.c, asnprintf, vasnprintf, asprintf, vasprintf</font>
</h1>

<p><b>snprintf</b> is a routine to convert numeric and string arguments
to formatted strings. It is similar to sprintf(3) provided in a
system's C library, yet it requires an additional argument - the buffer
size - and it guarantees never to store anything beyond the given buffer,
regardless of the format or arguments to be formatted. Some newer
operating systems do provide <b>snprintf</b> in their C library,
but many do not or do provide an inadequate (slow or idiosyncratic)
version, which calls for a portable implementation of this routine.

<h2>Terms and conditions ...</h2>

<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it
and/or modify it under the terms of the
<i><a href="./LICENSE.txt">Frontier Artistic License</a></i>
which comes with this Kit.

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>careful adherence to specs regarding flags, field width and precision;
<li>good performance for large string handling (large format, large argument
or large paddings). Performance is similar to system's <b>sprintf</b>
and in several cases significantly better (make sure you compile with
optimizations turned on, tell the compiler the code is strict ANSI
if necessary to give it more freedom for optimizations);
<li>return value semantics per ISO C9X;
<li>written in standard ISO/ANSI C - requires an ANSI C compiler.
</ul>

<h2>Supported formats and data types</h2>

<p>This <b>snprintf</b> only supports format specifiers:
s, c, d, o, u, x, X, p  (and synonyms: i, D, U, O - see below)
with flags: '-', '+', '&nbsp;', '0' and '#'.
An asterisk is supported for field width as well as precision.

<p>Data type modifiers 'h' (<i>short int</i>), 'l' (<i>long int</i>)
and 'll' (<i>long long int</i>) are supported.

<p>NOTE:
<blockquote>
If macro SNPRINTF_LONGLONG_SUPPORT is not defined (default)
the data type modifier 'll' is recognized but treated the same as 'l',
which may cause argument value truncation!
Defining SNPRINTF_LONGLONG_SUPPORT requires that your system's
<b>sprintf</b> also handles data type modifier 'll'.
<i>long long int</i> is a language extension which may not be portable.
</blockquote>

<p>Conversion of numeric data (formats d, o, u, x, X, p) with
data type modifiers (none or h, l, ll) is left to the system
routine <b>sprintf</b>, but all handling of flags, field width and precision
as well as c and s formats is done very carefully by this portable routine.
If a string precision (truncation) is specified (e.g. %.8s) it is
guaranteed the string beyond the specified precision will not be referenced.

<p>Data type modifiers h, l and ll are ignored for c and s formats
(data types <i>wint_t</i> and <i>wchar_t</i> are not supported).

<p>The following common synonyms for conversion characters are supported:
<ul>
<li>i is a synonym for d
<li>D is a synonym for ld, explicit data type modifiers are ignored
<li>U is a synonym for lu, explicit data type modifiers are ignored
<li>O is a synonym for lo, explicit data type modifiers are ignored
</ul>

<p>The following is specifically <b>not</b> supported:
<ul>
<li>flag ' (thousands' grouping character) is recognized but ignored
<li>numeric formats: f, e, E, g, G and synonym F
<li>data type modifier 'L' (<i>long double</i>)
and 'q' (<i>quad</i> - use 'll' instead)
<li>wide character/string formats: C, lc, S, ls
<li>writeback of converted string length: conversion character n
<li>the n$ specification for direct reference to n-th argument
<li>locales
</ul>

<p>It is permitted for str_m to be zero, and it is permitted to specify NULL
pointer for resulting string argument if str_m is zero (as per ISO C9X).

<p>The return value is the number of characters which would be generated
for the given input, <i>excluding</i> the trailing null. If this value
is greater or equal to str_m, not all characters from the result
have been stored in str. If str_m is greater than zero it is
guaranteed the resulting string will be null-terminated.

<p>NOTE that this matches the ISO C9X and GNU C library 2.1,
but is different from some older implementations!

<p>Routines asprintf and vasprintf return a pointer (in the ptr argument)
to a buffer sufficiently large to hold the resulting string. This pointer
should be passed to free(3) to release the allocated storage when it is
no longer needed. If sufficient space cannot be allocated, these functions
will return -1 and set ptr to be a NULL pointer. These two routines are a
GNU C library extensions (glibc).

<p>Routines asnprintf and vasnprintf are similar to asprintf and vasprintf,
yet, like snprintf and vsnprintf counterparts, will write at most str_m-1
characters into the allocated output string, the last character in the
allocated buffer then gets the terminating null. If the formatted string
length (the return value) is greater than or equal to the str_m argument,
the resulting string was truncated and some of the formatted characters
were discarded. These routines present a handy way to limit the amount
of allocated memory to some sane value.

<h2>Revision history</h2>

<p><b>Version 1.3 fixes a runaway loop problem from 1.2. Please upgrade.</b>

<dl>
<dt>1999-06-30	V1.3  Mark Martinec &lt;mark.martinec@ijs.si&gt;
<dd>- fixed runaway loop (eventually crashing when str_l wraps
  beyond 2*31) while copying format string without
  conversion specifiers to a buffer that is too short
  (thanks to Edwin Young &lt;edwiny@autonomy.com&gt; for spotting the problem);
<dd>- added macros PORTABLE_SNPRINTF_VERSION_(MAJOR|MINOR) to snprintf.h

<dt>2000-02-14	V2.0 (never released) Mark Martinec &lt;mark.martinec@ijs.si&gt;
<dd>- relaxed license terms:
  <a href="./LICENSE.txt">The Artistic License</a> now applies.
  You may still apply the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  as was distributed with previous versions, if you prefer;
<dd>- changed REVISION HISTORY dates to use
  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html">ISO 8601
  date format</a>;
<dd>- added vsnprintf (patch also independently proposed by
  Caol&aacute;n McNamara 2000-05-04, and Keith M Willenson 2000-06-01)

<dt>2000-06-27	V2.1  Mark Martinec &lt;mark.martinec@ijs.si&gt;
<dd>- removed POSIX check for str_m &lt; 1; value 0 for str_m is
  allowed by ISO C9X (and GNU C library 2.1) (pointed out
  on 2000-05-04 by Caol&aacute;n McNamara, caolan@ csn dot ul dot ie).
  Besides relaxed license this change in standards adherence
  is the main reason to bump up the major version number;
<dd>- added nonstandard routines asnprintf, vasnprintf, asprintf,
  vasprintf that dynamically allocate storage for the
  resulting string; these routines are not compiled by default,
  see comments where NEED_V?ASN?PRINTF macros are defined;
<dd>- autoconf contributed by Caol&aacute;n McNamara

<h2>Other implementations of snprintf</h2>

<p>I am aware of some other (more or less) portable implementations
of <b>snprintf</b>. I do not claim they are free software - please refer
to their respective copyright and licensing terms.
If you know of other versions please let
<a href="http://www.ijs.si/people/mark/">me</a> know.

<ul>
<li>a very thorough implementation (src/util_snprintf.c)
by the Apache Group distributed with the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache web server
- http://www.apache.org/</a> .
Does its own floating point conversions using routines
ecvt(3), fcvt(3) and gcvt(3) from the standard C library
or from the GNU libc.

<br>This is from the code:

In retrospect, it appears that a lot of effort was wasted by many
people for not being aware of what others are doing. Sigh.
